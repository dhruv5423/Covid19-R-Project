-   `data/analysis_data` contains the Cleaned COVID-19 data set that was constructed using the raw data.
-   `data/simulated_data` contains a detailed simulation of the data, prior to the analysis.
-   `other` contains sketches made prior to starting the project and chat history with ChatGPT Data Analyst.
-   `paper` contains the .qmd file used to generate the paper, a reference bibliography file, and the PDF output of the paper.
-   `scripts` contains the R scripts used to simulate, download and clean and test the COVID-19 data.


## Statement on LLM usage

The R Code used to simulate, download, clean, and analyze the data was produced largely with the help of LLMs, namely ChatGPT Data Analyst. A full disclosure of the chat history can be found in 'other/llm/llm_usage.txt'
